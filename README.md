### **About:**
I was tasked with creating a Telegram bot to collect anonymous feedback for Wee Kim Wee School of Communications Freshman Orientation Program. Freshmen can click /start and follow the instructions to leave feedback. For complete anonymity, remove line 200 from bot.py (it exposes the sender's username). 
Use BotFather to create a new bot and customise it. Get the API key and use in the Python script too. 
The Python script is available at bot.py. It is the most up to date script as of now. 
To allow the bot to run in the background, install cygwin and install tmux and dos2unix in the download process.
Use dos2unix to create a Linux environment on Windows and tmux to push the process into the background, after running bot.py on cygwin terminal. 
The user ID, username (optional), OG name and feedback will be displayed on the cygwin terminal and saved into a text file titled messages.txt.
